# üß† HTB

HTB (Henry‚Äôs Tiny Brain, or maybe Highly Typeable Bytecode ‚Äî the name's flexible) is a lightweight, Python-inspired interpreted language built for fun, learning, and general-purpose experimentation.

Written entirely in Python, HTB focuses on simplicity, readability, and giving you full control over the language-building process ‚Äî from tokenizing to parsing to execution.

This is just a simple project I want to work on over the easter holidays while my friends and girlfriend are studying. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features 

- Runs off of the custom .htb file extension
- Tokenizer (Lexer) and recursive-descent Parser
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
- Expression evaluation with dynamic typing
- Simple interpreter that executes AST nodes

## üöß Syntax Implemented So Far

- Variable assignment for Integers
- Simple Output for both variables and strings/integers/Boolean Values. 
- Outputs from the file main.htb (see example script)
- Simple arithmetic functionality
- You can fart with varying intensity with: fart [intensity: int] 

## ‚úÖ Goals & Outcomes

I'm not planning to replace python or anything, or even compete with it for that matter. This project was started because I wanted to learn more about how programming languages work behind the scenes. I also wanted to make a platform in which I could experiment with logic, beyond the capabilities of another language. To do this I need complete customisation! 

I am planning to make this pretty functional, and hopefully at the end have a neat little programming language (albeit with an ambiguous name...)
